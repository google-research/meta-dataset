  """Generates a stream of dataset IDs forming a sequence of episodes.

  Each episode is chunked into:

  * a "flush" chunk, which is meant to allow to flush examples, in case we are
    at the end of an epoch for one or more class in the episode (we want to
    avoid accidentally repeating an example due to epoch boundaries), and
  * some number of additional chunks (for example, a "support" chunk and a
    "query" chunk).

  To make sure the input pipeline knows where the episode boundary is within the
  stream (and where the boundary is between chunks in an episode), we enforce
  that each chunk has a fixed size by padding with dummy dataset IDs (of value
  `num_classes`) as needed (in some cases it's possible that no padding is ever
  needed). The size of each chunk is prescribed by the `compute_chunk_sizes`
  method of `sampler`, which also implicitly defines the number of additional
  chunks (i.e. `len(chunk_sizes) - 1`).

  This generator is meant to be used with
  `tf.data.experimental.choose_from_datasets` and assumes that the list of
  tf.data.Dataset objects corresponding to each class in the dataset (there are
  `num_classes` of them, which is determined by inspecting the `dataset_spec`
  argument using the `split` argument) is appended with a "dummy" Dataset (which
  has index `num_classes` in the list) which outputs a constant `(b'',
  DUMMY_CLASS_ID)` tuple).

  Note that a dataset ID is different from the (absolute) class ID: the dataset
  ID refers to the index of the Dataset in the list of Dataset objects, and the
  class ID (or label) refers to the second element of the tuple that the Dataset
  outputs.

  Args:
    dataset_spec: DatasetSpecification, dataset specification.
    split: one of Split.TRAIN, Split.VALID, or Split.TEST.
